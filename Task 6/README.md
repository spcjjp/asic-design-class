# AIM : Comparision of RISC-V Pre-Synthesis Simulation outputs using Iverilog GTKwave and Makerchip

The RISC-V processor was initially designed using TL-Verilog within the Makerchip IDE. To deploy it on an FPGA, the design had to be converted to Verilog, a task accomplished using the Sandpiper-SaaS compiler. Following this, pre-synthesis simulations were conducted using the GTKWave simulator.

## Simulation procedure, broken down into steps:

### Step 1: Install the Required Packages:

```c

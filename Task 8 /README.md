# LAB 3: AIM : Synthesis of 2:1 Multiplexer using Yosys and Logic Synthesis.

Yosys

Synthesizer is a tool for converting the RTL to Netlist and here we are using the Yosys as the Synthesizer.

A synthesizer plays a key role in digital design by transforming RTL (Register Transfer Level) code into a gate-level netlist. This netlist provides a detailed description of the circuit, outlining the logical gates and their interconnections, and serves as the foundation for later stages like place and route. In this design flow, the synthesizer being used is Yosys, an open-source tool for Verilog HDL synthesis. Yosys applies several optimization techniques to generate an efficient gate-level implementation from the RTL code.

Block Diagram of Yosys setup :

Block Diagram of synthesis Verification:

The primary inputs and outputs remain identical in both the RTL design and the synthesized netlist. As a result, the same test bench can be applied to both.

## Logic Systhesis

RTL Design: The design is described using a behavioral representation in Hardware Description Language (HDL) based on the required specifications.

Synthesis: The RTL (Register Transfer Level) code is translated into a gate-level representation. This process converts the design into gates and interconnections, resulting in a file known as the netlist.

## Design and Simulation of D Flip-Flops Using Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, and Yosys

This project showcases different coding approaches for D Flip-Flops and includes simulations using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave. Additionally, it explores the synthesis of these designs using Yosys. The simulations cover three varieties of D Flip-Flops:

    * D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset
    * D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Set
    * D Flip-Flop with Synchronous Reset

## 1. D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset:

Verilog code for the D Flip-Flop with an asynchronous reset:
```c 
module dff_asyncres(input clk, input async_reset, input d, output reg q);
	always@(posedge clk, posedge async_reset)
	begin
		if(async_reset)
			q <= 1'b0;
		else
			q <= d;
	end
endmodule
```
Testbench for Asynchronous Reset D Flip-Flop:
```
module tb_dff_asyncres; 
	reg clk, async_reset, d;
	wire q;
	dff_asyncres uut (.clk(clk), .async_reset(async_reset), .d(d), .q(q));

	initial begin
		$dumpfile("tb_dff_asyncres.vcd");
		$dumpvars(0, tb_dff_asyncres);
		clk = 0;
		async_reset = 1;
		d = 0;
		#3000 $finish;
	end
	
	always #10 clk = ~clk;
	always #23 d = ~d;
	always #547 async_reset = ~async_reset; 
endmodule

```
* Steps to Run the Simulation:

    Navigate to the directory where the Verilog files are located:
```
    cd /home/satya/vlsi/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```
   Run the following commands to compile and simulate the design:
```
iverilog dff_asyncres.v tb_dff_asyncres.v
ls
```
The compiled output will be saved as a.out.

 Execute the compiled output and open the waveform viewer:
```
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_asyncres.vcd
```
By following these steps,we can observe the behavior of the D Flip-Flop with an asynchronous reset in the waveform viewer:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb8036b8-0694-436a-a483-1863b0a3b532)

OBSERVATION : From the waveform, it can be observed that the Q output changes to zero when the asynchronous reset is set high, independent of the positive/negative clock edge.

## 2. Asynchronous Set

The velilog code for the Asynchronous set is given below :

```c

module dff_async_set(input clk, input async_set, input d, output reg q);
	always@(posedge clk, posedge async_set)
	begin
		if(async_set)
			q <= 1'b1;
		else
			q <= d;
	end
endmodule
```
Testbench code is as follows:
```c
module tb_dff_async_set; 
	reg clk, async_set, d;
	wire q;
	dff_async_set uut (.clk(clk),.async_set (async_set),.d(d),.q(q));

	initial begin
		$dumpfile("tb_dff_async_set.vcd");
		$dumpvars(0,tb_dff_async_set);
		// Initialize Inputs
		clk = 0;
		async_set = 1;
		d = 0;
		#3000 $finish;
	end
		
	always #10 clk = ~clk;
	always #23 d = ~d;
	always #547 async_set=~async_set; 
endmodule
```
Command steps :

Go to the required directory
```c
sudo -i
cd ~
cd /home/satya/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```
We just need to put few commands as stated below in order to see the waveforms.
```c
iverilog dff_async_set.v tb_dff_async_set.v
ls
```
After giving the above command the IVerilog stores the output as ' a.out '

Now let's execute the ' a.out ' file and observe the waveforms.
```c
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_async_set.vcd
```
Below is the Snapshot of the above commands and the resultant Waveforms:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a658af31-7170-4203-8804-1d9c111c93bd)

OBSERVATION : From the waveform, it can be observed that the Q output changes to one when the asynchronous set is set high, independent of the positive/negative clock edge.

## 3. Synchronous Reset

The velilog code for the Synchronous reset is given below :
```c

module dff_syncres(input clk, input sync_reset, input d, output reg q);
	always@(posedge clk)
	begin
		if(sync_reset)
			q <= 1'b0;
		else
			q <= d;
	end
endmodule
```
Testbench code is as follows:
```c
module tb_dff_syncres; 
	reg clk, syncres, d;
	wire q;
	dff_asyncres uut (.clk(clk),.sync_reset (sync_reset),.d(d),.q(q));

	initial begin
		$dumpfile("tb_dff_syncres.vcd");
		$dumpvars(0,tb_dff_syncres);
		// Initialize Inputs
		clk = 0;
		sync_reset = 1;
		d = 0;
		#3000 $finish;
	end
		
	always #10 clk = ~clk;
	always #23 d = ~d;
	always #547 sync_reset=~async_reset; 
endmodule
```
Command steps :

Go to the required directory
```
sudo -i
cd ~
cd /home/satya/vlsi/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```
We just need to put few commands as stated below in order to see the waveforms.
```
iverilog dff_syncres.v tb_dff_syncres.v

```
After giving the above command the IVerilog stores the output as ' a.out '

Now let's execute the ' a.out ' file and observe the waveforms.
```
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_syncres.vcd
```
Below is the Snapshot of the above commands and the resultant Waveforms:

	reg clk, reset;
	wire q;

	dff_const1 uut (.clk(clk),.reset(reset),.q(q));

	initial begin
		$dumpfile("tb_dff_const1.vcd");

 # Lab 8: AIM : GLS, Synthesis-Simulation mismatch, non - blocking and blocking statements.
 
## Gate Level Simulation (GLS) in Digital Circuit Verification

Gate Level Simulation (GLS) is a critical step in the verification process of digital circuits. This phase involves simulating the synthesized netlistâa lower-level representation of the designâusing a testbench to verify its logical correctness and timing behavior. By comparing the simulated outputs with the expected outputs, GLS ensures that the synthesis process has not introduced any errors and that the design meets its performance requirements.

Importance of Sensitivity Lists

Sensitivity lists are essential for achieving accurate circuit behavior. An incomplete sensitivity list can lead to unexpected latches, which may complicate the design's functionality.
Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments

Within always blocks, the use of blocking and non-blocking assignments plays a significant role:

* Blocking Assignments (=): These execute sequentially, which can inadvertently create latches if not managed properly.
* Non-Blocking Assignments (<=): These allow for parallel execution and help avoid issues related to timing and latches.

Best Practices

To prevent synthesis and simulation mismatches, itâs vital to:

* 1. Carefully Analyze Circuit Behavior: Understand the flow of signals and potential edge cases.
* 2. Ensure Proper Sensitivity Lists: Make sure that all relevant signals are included to avoid unintended behavior.
* 3. Choose the Right Assignment Type: Use blocking and non-blocking assignments appropriately based on the intended functionality.

By adhering to these practices, we can enhance the reliability and robustness of digital circuits, leading to successful implementations in real-world applications.

## Example 1 : There is no mismatch in this example as the netlist simulation and rtl simulation waveform are similar only
```c
module ternary_operator_mux (input i0 , input i1 , input sel , output y);
	assign y = sel?i1:i0;
endmodule
```
### Command steps for Simulation:
```
iverilog ternary_operator_mux.v tb_ternary_operator_mux.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_ternary_operator_mux.vcd
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e4f2ed2-ae81-4b4b-a98a-63d5acbd472e)

Synthesis:

```c
yosys       
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog ternary_operator_mux.v
synth -top ternary_operator_mux
```

```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/808d63e5-89f1-4b19-8b3b-661c28b15e34)

To see the Netlist
```c
write_verilog -noattr ternary_operator_mux_net.v
!gvim ternary_operator_mux_net.v
```

### Gate Level Synthesis (GLS)
Command steps :

Go to the required directory
```
sudo -i
cd ~
cd /home/vlsi/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```
We just need to put few commands as stated below in order to see the waveforms.
```
iverilog ../my_lib/verilog_model/primitives.v ../my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v ternary_operator_mux_net.v tb_ternary_operator_mux.v
ls
```
After giving the above command the IVerilog stores the output as ' a.out '

Now let's execute the ' a.out ' file and observe the waveforms.
```
./a.out
gtkwave tb_ternary_operator_mux.vcd
```
Below is the Snapshot of the above commands and the resultant Waveforms:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34d3f84a-9e2d-4f4d-b358-b977d8c10f0c)

These waveforms correspond to the GATE LEVEL SYNTHESIS for the Ternary Operator MUX.

  ## * Example 2: Design of a 2:1 Bad MUX

Verilog code:
```
module bad_mux(input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
	always@(sel)
	begin
		if(sel)
			y <= i1;
		else
			y <= i0;
	end
endmodule
```
Command steps for Simulation:
```
iverilog bad_mux.v tb_bad_mux.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_bad_mux.vcd
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5356b19-8b8b-4ea0-9e77-72555d5c2026)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dc9c503-7d15-401f-b3da-f534a81703e3)

To see the Netlist
```
write_verilog -noattr bad_mux_net.v
!gvim bad_mux_net.v
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ac851b0-dbb9-4255-80c5-d3728fd82df4)
From the waveform it can be observed that the output y changes only when there is a change in select line, completely ignoring the change in i0 and i1, which should also change the output y. Thus, this design is that of a bad MUX.

### Gate Level Synthesis (GLS)
Command steps :

Go to the required directory
```
sudo -i
cd ~
cd /home/vlsi/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```
We just need to put few commands as stated below in order to see the waveforms.
```
iverilog ../my_lib/verilog_model/primitives.v ../my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v bad_mux.v tb_bad_mux.v
ls
```
After giving the above command the IVerilog stores the output as ' a.out '

Now let's execute the ' a.out ' file and observe the waveforms.
```
./a.out
gtkwave tb_bad_mux.vcd
```
Below is the Snapshot of the above commands and the resultant Waveforms:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c5661e7-373f-498e-8bcb-758dffc92026)
These waveforms correspond to the GATE LEVEL SYNTHESIS for the Bad MUX.


##  Example 3: Blocking Caveat

Verilog code:

```c

module blocking_caveat(input a, input b, input c, output reg d);
	reg x;

	always@(*)
	begin
		d = x & c;
		x = a | b;
	end
endmodule
```
Command steps for Simulation:
```
iverilog blocking_caveat.v tb_blocking_caveat.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_blocking_caveat.vcd
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/881e0f93-e331-4785-b5f0-206a4536efd8)

As depicted, when A and B go zero, the OR gate output should be zero (X equal to zero), and the AND gate output should also be zero (same as D output). But, the AND gate input of X takes the previous value of A|B equal to one, based on the design created by the blocking statement, hence the discrepancy in the output.

## Gate Level Synthesis (GLS) Workflow

Welcome to the Gate Level Synthesis (GLS) section of the VLSI Sky130 RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop! Below are the command steps you'll need to follow in order to simulate your design and visualize the waveforms.

Step-by-Step Guide

1. Navigate to the Project Directory
```c
sudo -i
cd ~
cd /home/chandra-shekhar-jha/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```
2. Compile Your Verilog Files

Next, we need to compile the necessary Verilog files using IVerilog. Run the following command:

```
iverilog ../my_lib/verilog_model/primitives.v ../my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v blocking_caveat_net.v tb_blocking_caveat.v
```

3. Execute the Output File

Now itâs time to run the simulation and generate the waveform data:
```
./a.out
```
5. Visualize Waveforms with GTKWave

Finally, to visualize the results, you can open the waveform viewer:
```
gtkwave tb_blocking_caveat.vcd
```

WHAT IS RISC-V?
•	RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that allows developers to develop processors for specific applications.
•	RISC-V is based on reduced instruction set computer principles and is the fifth generation of processors built on this concept.
•	RISC-V can also be understood as an alternative processor technology which is free and open, meaning that it does not require you to purchase the license of RISC-V to use it.

INSTRUCTIONS FORMAT IN RISC-V
The instructions format of a processor is the way in which machine language instructions are structured and organized for a processor to execute. It is made up of series of 0s and 1s, each containing information about the location and operation of data.
There are 6 instruction formats in RISC-V:

1. R-type (Register)
Used for arithmetic and logical operations.


•	opcode:  Basic operation of the instruction.
•	rd:  Destination register.
•	Func t3: Additional opcode extension.
•	rs1:  First source register.
•	rs2:  Second source register.
•	funct7:  Further distinguishes between different instructions.

2. I-type (Immediate)
Used for immediate arithmetic, loads, and other operations that need a single immediate value.

•	opcode: Basic operation of the instruction.
•	rd: Destination register.
•	funct3: Additional opcode extension.
•	rs1: Source register.
•	immediate: Immediate value (12 bits).
3. S-type (Store)
Used for store instructions, where data is stored from a register to memory.
 
•	opcode: Basic operation of the instruction.
•	imm[11:5]: Part of the immediate value.
•	rs1: Base register.
•	rs2: Source register.
•	funct3: Additional opcode extension.
•	imm[4:0]: Part of the immediate value.
4. B-type (Branch)
Used for conditional branch instructions.
 
•	opcode: Basic operation of the instruction.
•	imm[12|10:5]: Part of the immediate value.
•	rs1: First source register.
•	rs2: Second source register.
•	funct3: Additional opcode extension.
•	imm[4:1|11]: Part of the immediate value.
5. U-type (Upper Immediate)
Used for instructions that operate with a 20-bit upper immediate value.
 
•	opcode: Basic operation of the instruction.
•	rd: Destination register.
•	immediate: Immediate value (20 bits).
6. J-type (Jump)
  Used for jump instructions with a 20-bit immediate value.
 
•	opcode: Basic operation of the instruction.
•	rd: Destination register.
•	immediate: Immediate value (20 bits).
These formats are designed to make decoding simple and efficient, ensuring that the RISC-V architecture remains true to its principles of simplicity and scalability.
